# CATbus Navigator UI

This repository contains the code for the frontend of the Catbus Navigator.  

The Catbus Navigator is a web application that allows users to navigate across Clemson's campus using the CATbus (the Clemson Area Transit bus system). It will function similarly to Google maps, but will display CATbus routes and use them to calculate navigation for users.

This project is being created for Clemson's CPSC-4720 class.
